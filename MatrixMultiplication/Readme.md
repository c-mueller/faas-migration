# Matrix Multiplication - Use Case

## Prerequisites

Generally all of these applications have the following prerequisites:
- .NET Framework Core SDK - Version 2.1 (including `dotnet` command)

## Unit Tests
Unlike all other Implementations this implementation has Unit tests to test the functionallity of the Core library.

### Running the Unit Tests

The unit tests can be executed by running the following commands in the `Tests` subdirectory:
```
dotnet restore # Only needed once
dotnet test
```

Sadly this approach of running the tests does not show any output apart from failures. To see the full Test ouptut please consider
using an IDE like JetBrains Rider or VisualStudio.
